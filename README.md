Named obnoxiously after the WWI flying ace, this project was built to record flight data from a remote control airplane. You can find overview information about it on my [blog](https://lohbihler.wordpress.com/) (the discussion starts [here](https://lohbihler.wordpress.com/2016/04/09/new-start/), with many more posts on it after that). It's primarily Java code that runs on a Raspberry Pi, and talks via RS232 to Arduino code running on a Nano.
